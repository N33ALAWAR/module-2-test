# Git & Github Instructions for test

Note: Test questions can be found on the index.html file

## Starting the test

1. Fork the test repository. The fork button is on the top-right hand side of your screen.
2. Once you've finished forking, create a folder on your local for the test. Then, clone the fork into a folder.
3. Copy and paste the test folder. Rename the copy to answers_yourname e.g. answers_benjamin.

## Finishing the test
1. When you're finished with the test, add your answers to the staging area using "git add filename".
2. Then, commit the changes using "git commit -m '' ". Do not forget to leave a commit message e.g. git commit -m "yourname test answers".
3. Finally, push your changes to your forked repository using "git push".

### Creating a pull request 
4. Once you have pushed your test answers, go to the original repo and click "New pull request" (middle & left of the page). Once you have clicked "New pull request", click "compare across forks". 
  It is very important that you compare the original to your fork. 
5. Then, you can give the pull request a title and description. Once you're ready, click "Create pull request".

That's it! Good luck :)
